## 2024-06-09: Performance & Robustness Improvements by AI

### What was done

- Wrapped the following components with React.memo for better list rendering performance:
  - GridProductCard
  - ListProductCard
  - ProductCard
  - CartProduct
  - ProductList
- Confirmed all expensive calculations are already memoized (useMemo/useCallback).
- Confirmed all API and async logic have robust error handling and user feedback.
- Confirmed in-memory caching is used where appropriate.
- No useless or redundant operations were found.
- No breaking changes or unoptimized code were introduced.

### What was not done

- No further memoization or caching was added, as all critical areas are already optimized.
- No changes to error handling, as it is already robust.
- No changes to business logic or UI.
